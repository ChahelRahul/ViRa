  <h1>Our Story</h1>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Victoria and Rahul met in 2022 in Aberdeen, Scotland. Both were newcomers to the UK, each arriving to pursue a Master’s degree and a bit of personal growth along the way.</p>

    <p>They first connected through an international students’ group chat, bonding over a shared goal: finding a gym partner. On 25 August 2022, they met up for the first time at Aberdeen Sports Village (ASV). Even though Victoria had no real idea what Olympic weightlifting was, she gave it her best shot!</p>

    <p>From that day on, they became regular gym buddies, and before long, they were spending time together outside the gym too. By January 2023, they had trained so consistently they both competed in their first Olympic Weightlifting competition together.</p>

    <p>Their friendship turned into something deeper, built through shared workouts, late-night chats, travels across the UK, and cheering each other on through career shifts and life changes. They celebrated milestones, big and small, and became one another’s biggest supporters.</p>

    <p>In March 2024, they moved to Edinburgh, where they now live together by the beach. And in January 2025, Rahul asked Victoria to marry him.</p>

    <p>These days, they’re still working on their Olympic lifts (sometimes hitting PRs, sometimes missing) but always cheering each other on, in the gym and in life.</p>

    <p>They’ve built something strong, joyful, and full of love and they can’t wait to keep growing together.</p>

    <h2>In Their Words</h2>

    <div class="quote-block">
      <strong>Rahul:</strong>
      “She fills each moment with every hue,<br />
      From starlit skies to morning dew.<br />
      <br />      
      She's thunder, she's calm — a storm and a sigh,<br />
      The reason I breathe, the fire in my sky.<br />
      <br />
      She brings me joy I never knew,<br />
      A world reborn in shades of new.<br />
      <br />
      And if you ask me why I smile —<br />
      It's her. It’s always been her... all the while.”<br />
    </div>

    <div class="quote-block">
      <strong>Victoria:</strong>
      “I have a dream, oh yes I do, and well, it does come true.<br />
      He has deep eyes, full of love.<br />
      He has the biggest, strongest hugs.<br />
      He makes me smile on the darkest days.<br />
      And I don't know what I would do if he ever went away.<br />
      I dream of him when he is not around.<br />
      I hold my breath to hear his voice aloud.<br />
      The plans I have, he has them too.<br />
      He cares for me and I can't believe it's true.<br />
      I have a dream.<br />
      And don't you see?<br />
      He is the only dream I will ever need.”
